\begin{abstract}
 Learning of e.g. a dexterous motor skill,  which is common in medical
training, sports or playing a musical instrument, is time-costly and
needs supervision from a teacher,  to avoid injury and to progress. Importantly, learning a
motor skill requires active practice, and adjusting one's own individual
embodiment to perform the target movement.  Open research questions are: How to balance self-regulated and exploratory
practice with teacher-guided practice?  How to adjust the teacher guidance strategy that
has been optimized by teacher to fit their experience and embodiment, to suite the learner's own
unique talents?  How can the learner improve \textit{beyond} the
performance of the teacher?  
We introduce a  meta unit for co-constructing a computational scaffold for learning, that targets to integrate the teacher, the learner and a computational optimization approach, represented by a Dyna-Q $\epsilon$-greedy  reinforcement learning agent. 
In this preliminary work,  the meta unit is implemented as a Bernoulli distribution, which is parameterized by average reward gained by the simulated learner. Sampling from this distribution regulates the interventions of the  simulated teacher. 
On the one hand, the resulting procedure regulates the interventions of the teacher during the learning process dynamically, if the learner is failing to progress.   
On the other hand, the learner employs a  model of their talents, provided within the Dyna-Q agent,  and schedules their practice with a trade-off between exploration and self-regulated practice. Under the assumption of difference in embodiments between the teacher and the learner,  this approach aims to enable the learner to discover their own optimal learning policy, while being guided by the teacher on-demand, with the ultimate goal to improve  beyond the capacity of the teacher.

\section{Introduction}
Learning of e.g. a dexterous motor skill,  which is common in medical
training, sports or playing a musical instrument, is time-costly and
requires, on the one hand, supervision from a teacher,  to avoid injury and to progress. In most of the above-mentioned scenarios, in particular in medical training and in sports associated with a high risk of injury, it is obligatory to be guided by a teacher, and not sufficient to try out different learning strategies without being lead by an expert. 
 On the other hand,  learning a complex 
motor skill requires a lengthy and active practice, training and adjusting one's own individual
embodiment\footnote{"The word embodied refers to the dual valence of the
notion of body: bodiness is a combination of a physical
structure (the biological body) and an experiential
structure, which corresponds to the living, moving,
suffering, and enjoying body. From here it is possible
to arrive at the dual acceptation of embodied cognition,
which refers, on the one hand, to the grounding of
cognitive processes in the brain’s neuroanatomical
substratum, and on the other, to the derivation of
cognitive processes from our organism’s sensorimotor
experiences".~\cite{encyclopedia}} to perform the target movement.   
Parents often observe, how small children insist on self-regulatory learning, and refuse to be helped/guided. They still try to perform the movement,  such as  eating with a spoon, even though the result is often not robust,  as would be, if guided  by the parents. Guidance of babies by their parents  is one example in which the teacher and the learner strongly differ in embodiment.  It is likely that the teacher and the learner are rarely characterized by a completely overlapping set of talents, although in this work we do not differentiate between observable and non-observable differences yet.  Another prominent example of embodiment differences is in a motor rehabilitation setting. Here in particular, each patient has their own skills that need to be relearned. 

The main  question  that we are
interested in exploring is: How to balance self-regulated,  exploratory practice, and develop awareness of ones' own talents  with teacher-guided practice? 
In this work we explore a meta unit which co-constructs a learning scaffold, integrating  a teacher model, an agent trained with Dyna-Q reinforcement learning (RL), and a  simulated learner.  This approach looks to find an optimal combination of self-regulatory talent mining of the learner and on-demand teacher guidance. 

\section{Related work}

Scaffolding for learning~\cite{encyclopedia} is a term that originates from the educational psychology. “Scaffolding is a reciprocal feedback process in which a more expert other (e.g.,
teacher, or peer with greater expertise) interacts with a less knowledgeable learner, with the goal of
providing the kind of conceptual support that enables the learner, over time, to be able to work with
the task, content, or idea independently”~\cite{encyclopedia}. While being a  rigorously researched topic in educational domains~(e.g.~\cite{brunskill23,passen21,amy}), such as mathematics and programming, the domain of computational scaffolding of motor learning is relatively new.  The domain has a huge relevance due to its range that stretches from learning musical instruments to relearning during rehabilitation.
One of the earlier works~\cite{soeren} describes a setup in which a simulated learner is given exercise units, termed practice modes, that are optimized based on their corresponding utility. 
  Related  approach maps both the learner state and  target parameters of the training to a suitable exercise unit~\cite{gauss}. The model is trained in a supervised manner  with the ground truth provided by a  teacher and recorded during the training session with the learner.   This approach is teacher-driven and does not contain any exploratory or self-regulated learning that can be performed by the learner by themselves. 
Other approach uses reinforcement learning to schedule exercises  for the human learner~\cite{nature} based on the achieved reward and the state of their ability.  Here only the agent is used to guide the learner, and the teacher is not explicitly modeled.  Similar to~\cite{soeren}, the authors of~\cite{megha} propose the so-called teachable skills, segments of a motor task that can be selected and  recombined to form individual drills for the learner. There are common aspects to the above approaches. They aim to assess the capabilities of the learner, and to generate an individually tuned sequence of exercise units. 
The above-mentioned scaffolding principle is inspired by the traditional literature on motor learning with a human teacher (e.g.~\cite{cortot}). Here, it is common for a learner to get small exercise units that are derived by simplification or related to the target task. Here we will explore the challenge of embodiment differences between the learner  and the teacher, and resulting from this, the need to empower the learner to learn in self-regulatory manner and mine their own talents, but also get support from the teacher if needed.    
This work aims at merging the two approaches to computational training, teacher-driven, and the reinforcement learning-driven. 


\section{Methods}
% , enabling highly adaptive and patient-customized therapeutic intervention. An immersive VR system for the rehabilitation of reaching movement using a bubble popping game is proposed. In the virtual space, the patient is presented with bubbles appearing at different locations and is asked to reach the bubble with the injured limb and pop it. The implementation of a Q-learning algorithm enables the game to adjust the location of the next bubble according to the performance of the patient, represented by his kinematic characteristics
The method is builds upon two main assumptions. Firstly, we assume that both teacher-guided and self-regulated learning have to co-construct a computational scaffolding system. Roughly speaking, the teacher contributes the knowledge of the domain/skill, and the learner  contributes the capability to explore their individual talents.   Secondly, teacher and learner differ in their embodiment.  For simplification, we  formalize this by non-overlapping ground truth policies that are considered optimal w.r.t. skill improvement rate by the teacher and the learner, respectively (see next section for more detail). 
The proposed meta unit manages interaction of the simulated teacher, simulated learner, and an agent. 
The agent is  inspired by previous work in \cite{nature}, in which the authors pursue an adaptive and patient-customized therapeutic intervention for rehabilitation of reaching movement. There the simulated patients interact with a Q-learning algorithm that adjusts the virtual reality (VR) game according to the performance of the patient. Building upon this approach, in our work  a state corresponds to the skill level, and an action corresponds to an exercise unit. Reward reflects how hard the learner is working,  rewarding an improvement in the skill level.  
Extending upon the work performed in~\cite{nature}, our agent is trained by $\epsilon$-greedy Dyna-Q RL~\cite{sutton} from both the learner learning process and the  teacher guidance data. Dyna-Q blends model-free and model-based RL approaches and is employed due to its  known sample efficiency.  In our approach it integrates the teacher and the learner embodiments (see next section for a detailed description), and results in a policy that optimizes the improvement  rate of the learner under this condition.  During training of the policy, the teacher guides the learner only in the situation when the learner's own learning strategy is not successful. 
In the current approach the learner queries the agent to provide them with an exercise unit (action), given their level of skill (state) in each step. 
Improvement rate is calculated based on how quickly the learner moves from one skill state to the next, while only such transitions are associated with a reward.  Currently, the RL agent is the only model being optimized. 

\subsection{States, actions, rewards}
The experimental setup consists of a set of states $S=\{s_1, \ldots, s_{15}\}$, which represents different skill levels.  The goal of the learner is to get from the state $s_1$ to the end state $s_{15}$. The set of actions $A= \{a_1,a_2,a_3\}$ represents exercise units, or the types of training that the learner can perform, either under guidance or by themselves.   The reward is equal 1,  in case the chosen action results in a transition from the current state $s_i$ to the next $s_{i+1}$, corresponding to the skill improvement. Otherwise, the reward is $r=0$.   In our work we assume that only two transitions are possible:  from $s_i$ to $s_{i+1}$  corresponding to skill improvement, or staying in same $s_i$, which  corresponds to staying on the same skill level.

In order to model the differences in embodiment for the teacher and the learner, we have defined a tuple of individual ground truth actions that improve the skill level for the teacher and the learner policy, respectively. Only these result in a positive reward and a  transition to the next state, i.e. 
$A^*_T:= (a_{T,1},\ldots, a_{T,15}) \neq (a_{L,1}, \ldots, a_{L,15}):= A^*_L$.  Here  $A^*_T$ denotes the tuple of optimal exercise units corresponding to the teacher policy, while $A^*_L$ corresponds to the exercise units optimal for the learner.  According to our assumption these tuples are not identical, however they are allowed to partially  overlap in order to allow for some similarities between the teacher and the learner.  
 Therefore, by construction, there is an optimal  action $a_{T,i}$  and $a_{L,i}$  in each state $s_i, i \in (1,\ldots, 15)$, determined by the teacher and the learner differences in embodiment.   
 
 \subsection{Teacher, learner, agent and the meta unit}
 The pseudocode for the training of the meta unit is in Section  Appendix~\ref{code:meta}.
To sum up the main modeling assumptions and functionalities:

    \paragraph{The \textbf{teacher}} has one functionality - to guide according to their optimal policy $A^*_T$. Per design,  performed action is always rewarded with $r=1$, the learner skill state moves to the next level.  All data resulting from the intervention, $(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}, r)$ are given to the RL-agent for training. 
    
    \paragraph{The \textbf{learner}} is simulated with an improvement probability threshold, currently set to 0.2. Through sampling from the uniform distribution and comparing the resulting value with the above threshold, we  determine, whether in case an optimal action according to $A^*_L$ is selected  and performed by the learner, the process results in  a state transition and a corresponding  reward, or in none of the above.  This simulates that even correct practice does not  results in an improvement directly.  Higher improvement threshold corresponds to more optimal actions leading to zero reward, and therefore, to a need for  higher intervention rate by the teacher. 
    \paragraph{The \textbf{agent}} is a Dyna-Q reinforcement learner. Dyna-Q integrates model-based elements into Q-learning. Specifically, it uses a model of the environment to simulate experience and update Q-values, in addition to learning from real interactions. According to this, our implementation has a model-free table $q(s,a)$ for choosing of the action $a*$ with the highest Q-value, given state $s$;  and a model part for simulation, consisting of the transition function $\tau(s,a)$ that maps to $(s',r)$, i.e. for a state $s$ and action $a$ it models the state after transition $s'$ and the corresponding reward $r$.  The model-based part of the Dyna-Q is in particular responsible for modeling of the learner talents.  The agent is implemented with an $\epsilon$-greedy approach, i.e. we use  $\epsilon=0.1$ to define the exploration factor.   The agent samples its policy and offers the learner an exercise unit $a_i$ that either maximizes the Q-value or is random, given current state of the learner, and the available policy.  According to their improvement rate (described above) and in the case in which the action corresponds to the optimal action defined in $A^*_L$,  the learner performs the action, moves to the next skill level, receives the positive reward. The resulting data $(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1},r)$ is provided to the agent for training.  In the other case, in which the sampled value is below the improvement rate, or the action does not match to the ground truth, a reward $r=0$ is emitted. 
     Importantly, the Q-learner updates all state-action-reward information that the experimental process yields.
    \paragraph{The \textbf{meta unit}} is currently implemented as a Bernoulli distribution, and is directly parameterizd by the mean reward achieved during the past 10 steps by the learner. The exception are the first 10 steps. Here the learner is given a chance to learn completely by themselves.  The parameter that determines the teacher intervention probability is calculated as $(1 - \textrm{average reward})$ in each step. This means, the higher the average learner reward, the smaller the probability of the teacher intervention.  The smaller the average learner reward, corresponding to an unsuccessful self-guided learning, the higher the probability of the teacher intervention. In case the meta unit does not schedule the  teacher to intervene and   guide the learning, the action is generated by the Q-learner. This results in either a random action, or  a sample from the currently available Q-table.  This enables the learner to either learn by themselves, or get guidance from the teacher, if they seem not to improve quickly enough.


\section{Results}
We have trained the Q-learner under the supervision of the  meta unit. In each step, the meta unit decides, based on the average reward analysis, whether the teacher should guide, or the learner should query the Q-learner agent to generate an action (random or optimized based on the currently available policy). 
We employ embodiments of the learner and  the teacher  $A^*_L$ and $A^*_T$, respectively, to assess which actions, given the state of the learner, generate a skill improvement and a positive reward. We    evaluate the policy w.r.t. improvement ratio for multiple  training runs under the supervision of the meta-unit. After each number of training runs, we evaluate how well  the resulting trained policy represented only by the Q-learner agent is capable of guiding the learner, without the meta unit, resulting in no teacher intervention.      

The improvement rate of the human learner ($x$-axis) achieved for different number of training iterations performed by the meta unit ($y$-axis) is  illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:my_label} (Appendix) in grey color. Here the teacher and the Q-agent guide the learner together. 
We have also performed the evaluation of the resulting trained policy, i.e. scaffolding without teacher guidance, performed  just by the \textit{frozen}  Q-agent after the training with the meta-unit has been finished. This means that just the trained Q-learner generates the exercise units and the learner either succeeds in transition or not, determined by the correctness of the action and the improvement threshold of the learner. The evaluation of the corresponding Q-learner model is showed in blue color in the same Figure \ref{fig:my_label}.  We have trained and evaluated the meta unit for the case in which 1/5th of the optimal actions were different for the teacher and the learner  ($A^*_T$ and  $A^*_L$, respectively).  The results  in the grey plot show that  the higher  number of training episodes performed by the meta unit result in higher improvement rate achieved by the learner,  which is calculated as an average of the received rewards given the number of learning steps until the end state is achieved.  After approx. 40 training runs, we can observe a saturation. The resulting improvement rate oscillates around the level of 0.8.  The frozen Q-learner  employed alone without teacher interventions (blue colored plot) yields an improvement rate that is lower than the meta unit policy (grey colored plot) on the whole range of the $x-$axis.  These results may imply that it is better to use the meta unit rather than the trained Q-learner alone in the case in which the teacher and the learner are assumed to have different embodiments.  


\section{Discussion}

We presented a method for co-constructing a scaffold to guide the learner, with a focus on the differences between the teacher and learner embodiments. Since we assume that the overlap between the optimal actions of the teacher and learner is unknown, our current approach utilizes all available information, i.e. state, transition, action, and reward from both teacher guidance and learner actions, to train the Q-learner.  This likely explains why  individual performance of the Q-learner is inferior to that of the meta unit. In future work, we aim to implement a more advanced training method for the Q-agent, which can identify instances where the teacher’s guiding actions do not overlap with the learner’s optimal actions and exclude such guidance from Q-learner training.

For long-term future work, there exist an approach that, to our knowledge,  has not yet found realization in the computational motor learning research, is something that  we call \textit{adversarial scaffolding}. This describes giving exercises to the learner that are slightly or more  beyond their current capacity, which, therefore, lead the learner to get outside their comfort zone.  For example, the musicians practice playing a piece in the reverse order, or with an extended rhythmic structure.  This is a potentially interesting topic for computational modelling and we will attempt to integrate this idea into the simulated  experiment in the next step of our work. To this end, we will need to define a more sophisticated state and action simulation.  This is a necessary step before conducting experiments with real learners.

% \item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.


% \item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader, select the
%   menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show All Fonts. You can
%   also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes with \verb+xpdf+ and is
%   available out-of-the-box on most Linux machines.


% \item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap fonts.  Use
%   "solid" shapes instead.


% \item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You should use
%   the equivalent AMS Fonts:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \usepackage{amsfonts}
% \end{verbatim}
% followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or \verb+\mathbb{C}+
% for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You can also use the following
% workaround for reals, natural and complex:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
%   \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
%   \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
% \end{verbatim}
% Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the \verb+amssymb+ package.


% \end{itemize}


% If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we will ask
% you to fix it.


% \subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}


% Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
% \verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
% \verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always specify the
% figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the example below:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
%   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
% \end{verbatim}
% See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
% (\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf})


% A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly hyphenate a
% line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \verb+\-+ command when
% necessary.

% \section*{NeurIPS Paper Checklist}

% %%% BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS %%%
% The checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible machine learning research, addressing issues of reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact. Do not remove the checklist: {\bf The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected.} The checklist should follow the references and follow the (optional) supplemental material.  The checklist does NOT count towards the page
% limit. 

% Please read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these questions. For each question in the checklist:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item You should answer \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item \answerNA{} means either that the question is Not Applicable for that particular paper or the relevant information is Not Available.
%     \item Please provide a short (1–2 sentence) justification right after your answer (even for NA). 
%   % \item {\bf The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected.}
% \end{itemize}

% {\bf The checklist answers are an integral part of your paper submission.} They are visible to the reviewers, area chairs, senior area chairs, and ethics reviewers. You will be asked to also include it (after eventual revisions) with the final version of your paper, and its final version will be published with the paper.

% The reviewers of your paper will be asked to use the checklist as one of the factors in their evaluation. While "\answerYes{}" is generally preferable to "\answerNo{}", it is perfectly acceptable to answer "\answerNo{}" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., "error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive" or "we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"). In general, answering "\answerNo{}" or "\answerNA{}" is not grounds for rejection. While the questions are phrased in a binary way, we acknowledge that the true answer is often more nuanced, so please just use your best judgment and write a justification to elaborate. All supporting evidence can appear either in the main paper or the supplemental material, provided in appendix. If you answer \answerYes{} to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.

% IMPORTANT, please:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item {\bf Delete this instruction block, but keep the section heading ``NeurIPS paper checklist"},
%     \item  {\bf Keep the checklist subsection headings, questions/answers and guidelines below.}
%     \item {\bf Do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your answers}.
% \end{itemize} 
 

% %%% END INSTRUCTIONS %%%


% \begin{enumerate}

% \item {\bf Claims}
%     \item[] Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper.
%         \item The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. 
%         \item The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. 
%         \item It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper. 
%     \end{itemize}

% \item {\bf Limitations}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. 
%         \item The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
%         \item The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
%         \item The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
%         \item The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
%         \item The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
%         \item If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
%         \item While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
%     \end{itemize}

% \item {\bf Theory Assumptions and Proofs}
%     \item[] Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. 
%         \item All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
%         \item All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
%         \item The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. 
%         \item Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
%         \item Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced. 
%     \end{itemize}

%     \item {\bf Experimental Result Reproducibility}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
%         \item If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
%         \item If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. 
%         \item Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
%         \item While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example
%         \begin{enumerate}
%             \item If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
%             \item If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
%             \item If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
%             \item We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
%         \end{enumerate}
%     \end{itemize}


% \item {\bf Open access to data and code}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
%         \item Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (\url{https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy}) for more details.
%         \item While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
%         \item The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (\url{https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy}) for more details.
%         \item The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
%         \item The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
%         \item At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
%         \item Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
%     \end{itemize}


% \item {\bf Experimental Setting/Details}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
%         \item The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
%         \item The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
%     \end{itemize}

% \item {\bf Experiment Statistical Significance}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
%         \item The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
%         \item The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
%         \item The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
%         \item The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
%         \item It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
%         \item It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96\% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
%         \item For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
%         \item If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
%     \end{itemize}

% \item {\bf Experiments Compute Resources}
%     \item[] Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
%         \item The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
%         \item The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. 
%         \item The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper). 
%     \end{itemize}
    
% \item {\bf Code Of Ethics}
%     \item[] Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics \url{https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines}?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
%         \item If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.
%         \item The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
%     \end{itemize}


% \item {\bf Broader Impacts}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
%         \item If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
%         \item Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
%         \item The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
%         \item The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
%         \item If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
%     \end{itemize}
    
% \item {\bf Safeguards}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
%         \item Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. 
%         \item Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
%         \item We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
%     \end{itemize}

% \item {\bf Licenses for existing assets}
%     \item[] Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
%         \item The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
%         \item The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
%         \item The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
%         \item For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
%         \item If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, \url{paperswithcode.com/datasets} has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
%         \item For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

%         \item The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
%         \item Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. 
%         \item The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
%         \item At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
%     \end{itemize}

% \item {\bf Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects}
%     \item[] Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? 
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:

%         \item The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
%         \item Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. 
%         \item According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector. 
%     \end{itemize}

% \item {\bf Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects}
%     \item[] Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?
%     \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
%     \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
%     \item[] Guidelines:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
%         \item Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. 
%         \item We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. 
%         \item For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
